  Whether you are a talented engineer or manager or "insert your role", you should make an additional effort to give your name recognition.

In your `Definition of Done` you should have one hidden item, personally for yourself - **Present your work!**

As a manager for engineers, for me, it's _easy_ to earn points for work my folks delivered, I like talking and make connections. 

...but I don't do it.

Instead, my goal is to help my folks to build a `brand` around their names.

We chat about feature, work they did, and how and where they should `announce` about it.

Some stuff can be simply a `Slack` message in an Engineering channel, other can be a 5-minute walkthrough in the Engineering guild call, more serious stuff should go into `Brown` bag session.

When you are done with your Task, Epic, Project or Initiative â€” it's not 100% done for you until you go out and **share news about your work**.

1. Don't abuse it, not everything should be announced outside your team, don't spam. Check with your team or manager if it is worth to share out. 
2. Measure your work to decide the best approach to make an announcement.
3. Don't be shy. I know not everyone like to speak outside the `close` circle. Ask for help, you will find people will glad-fully help you to organize stuff and support you.

Presenting is a hard skill you need to train, it will build a better communication skill too, and set a mindset of an early awareness for you to identify how to build and present a project.

Thank you for coming to my `TED Talk`.
