Second post in the series of Flutter and Google Maps.

In the [First post](./flutter-google-maps-setup) we have set up Google Maps and dependencies in a Flutter project.

In this post, I will cover how to add embedded Google Maps to your Flutter project.

## Table of contents

## Desired Outcome

We want to have a simple Flutter app with a Google Map embedded in it.

The map should appear on the child screen after User taps on the `Show map` button.

The map should show a marker at the user's current location.

## Add a new screen

The current folder structure of the project is as follows:

<ImageSlider
    images={[
        [projectStructure, 'Project folders'],
        [initialAppRender, 'Initial App view'],
    ]}
/>

We will add a new screen to the project to serve as a home screen: HomeScreen.

... TBD
