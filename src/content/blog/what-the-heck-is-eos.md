## Overview

Sometimes, a book crosses our desk promising to revolutionize how we work, think, and lead.

[What the Heck is EOS? by Gino Wickman and Tom Bouwer](https://www.eosworldwide.com/what-the-heck-is-eos) is one such book, aimed at simplifying processes and improving organizational alignment.

This article isn't about tearing down the book or exalting it.

It's about taking an honest look at what Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) brings to the table, based on my observation, Stay22's leadership team, and my wife :D

Why? Because if there's one thing we can all agree on, it's that we need systems that help us work better - but not at the expense of our sanity.

## Key Moments About EOS

At its core, EOS is about improving collaboration, accountability, and transparency within an organization.

It teaches teams to address problems openly, prioritize issues, and commit to structured processes.

Sounds good, right? In theory, yes.

The framework emphasizes regular leadership meetings, clearly defined roles, and systematic problem-solving.

Its simplicity is both its strength and its `Achilles heel`.

At Stay22 EOS was introduced to structure chaotic leadership meetings.

The intention was noble - moving from unproductive gatherings to actionable outcomes.

While there were improvements, it became evident that the process was not a cure-all. `The human factor` - the unpredictability of people - can make any process imperfect. And that's okay.

The book suggests that for companies with over 10 people, a framework like EOS becomes essential.

This is particularly true for organizations scaling rapidly, where clarity and consistency are paramount.

Yet, even with structure, I observed that leadership meetings often drifted toward a “Go-To-Market” format, sidelining certain teams.

This raises a crucial question: does EOS truly create inclusivity, or does it risk reinforcing existing silos?

## How Bad Were Our Leadership Meetings?

Our leadership meetings were falling short—by a wide margin.

As our CEO observed after sitting in on a recent session, they lacked structure, outcomes, and the impact a critical meeting like this should deliver.

These meetings felt more like going through the motions than tackling the real problems and opportunities facing the company.

On positive side of things, we have the talent and the drive to do much better.

At Stay22, COO implemented EOS through a Trello board, leading to measurable improvements in the leadership meeting format.

However, these gains didn't come without challenges.

Meetings still lacked decisions, accountability, and transparency. But I see small incremental improvements, and we can call it a win.

## Thoughts About the Book

Let's be brutally honest: `What the Heck is EOS?` doesn't reinvent the wheel.

I found the book repetitive and, at times, tedious.

Testimonials and chapter summaries felt like filler, and the writing lacked the depth one might expect from a book positioned as a business guide.

It could have been half the length without losing any substance.

Tone of the book is prescriptive, examples felt fabricated, and plenty of overuse of testimonials.

## Thoughts About the EOS

While the concepts, like clarity of roles and incremental problem-solving, are sound, they're not groundbreaking.

Many of these principles you learn through experience or borrow from better-executed frameworks.

It provides a structured approach to meetings and goal setting, which can be helpful for organizations struggling with chaos.

One critical takeaway: `EOS isn't a one-size-fits-all solution`; it's a suggestion, not a Bible.

Coincidentally me and my wife read this book the same day and the following day we discussed this book and EOS.

We concluded the framework can guide teams, but expecting perfection is unrealistic.

The human factor will always play a role, and rigid adherence to any process can be counterproductive.

## The End of the Story

`What the Heck is EOS?` is a book with a solid concept buried under layers of repetition and self-promotion.

It's not a masterpiece, but it doesn't have to be.

It serves as a reminder that structure and discipline can improve collaboration, even if the framework itself isn't perfect.

I have an opportunity to experience EOS at Stay22, and I can say it illustrates both its potential and its pitfalls.

The process brought some order to chaotic leadership meetings, but it didn't solve deeper issues like lack of accountability or inclusivity.

And that's the heart of the matter: no process, no matter how well-designed, can succeed without `genuine commitment from people`.

In the end, EOS is a tool - one of many. Use it as a guide, not gospel.

> We don't need to be fanatics about this process.

The **success** of any framework ultimately **depends on the people using it**.

Keep pushing forward. But don't lose sight of what really matters - vision, collaboration, and the courage to make hard decisions when it counts.

Stay curious. Stay bold. Stay `human`
