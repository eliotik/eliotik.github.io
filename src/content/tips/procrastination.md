title: Don't focus on improving your productivity
draft: false
---

Instead of spending time and money on finding and using `productivity` tools, you should focus on fighting `procrastination`.

Start by simply collecting data around your procrastination:
- What is `your` root cause? Are you having fear of failure, you don't have motivation, too much on your plate?
- Do you have clear goals? Check a couple of times your goals/tasks, maybe they are not clear, not specific enough, maybe they are not achievable and your gutt feeling messes with your mind?
- Do you follow any particular `schedule`?
- Do you have any distraction? If you find anything, see how to remove it or minimize it. Even rare Slack notification can break you out of the stream.

I can go further on the list of examples, but you can practice your Google skills and find more ideas how to identify if you are procrastinating.

People tend to focus on `time management` as a thing to improve productivity; they start using some tools and services to manage their day, but in fact, valuable time can be found in those gaps where you are procrastinating.

I use brain-dump approach, in the morning I fill template, identify a list of all goals I need to achieve, prioritize only three of them for the day, all the rest move to the weekly bucket of goals.
In the same template, I add notes on what I should be aware of, what risks, whom I should contact, etc.
After I'm done with this exercise, I can focus on my day following clear plan. 

Do I procrastinate? Yes, I do! You should too. But you can control it, and let it happen as a treatment after a goal from your list is **done**.
