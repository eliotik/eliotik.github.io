title: Prioritize systems over solo effort

I once believed I could handle every engineering challenge on my own. I chose to rely on my own effort instead of building efficient systems and relying on my teams. This was a mistake.

Attempting to do everything yourself creates a dependency on a single person, which limits the team's output and leads to your own burnout. This method is not sustainable and prevents the team from developing and growing. It failed because a team's progress depends on shared processes, not one person's work ethic.

Your primary role as a leader is to develop the infrastructure your team needs to succeed.

Build systems and work with teams instead of doing everything alone. Your time is better spent creating well-defined procedures and clear communication, not just writing code.

The goal is to create a department that can operate effectively without your direct involvement in every task. That is the only way to achieve consistent results.
