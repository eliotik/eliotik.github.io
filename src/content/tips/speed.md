Rapid action means more interactions with reality, leading to faster learning.

Speed forces `focus` on essentials, eliminating distractions.

When you are in a hurry, you don't have time to waste on unimportant details.

Think about your desired outcome, and focus on the most important tasks that will get you there.

But... it also depends on the context.

Some tasks require constant shift to the _right_ direction and slow and steady progress will be the right approach.

When you read `The Tortoise and the Hare` fable, you can see that both approaches have their place.

I believe that your time is a precious resource, so use it wisely.
