> Bureaucracy = lots of rules making simple things complex.

Make a habit of yours to challenge unnecessary complexity and red tape.

If you can encourage others to do the same, you will find things move faster around.

Set collaboration as your main priority over organizational barriers.

I'm sure you are going to see a lot of resistance, but it's worth it; people will work productively together.
