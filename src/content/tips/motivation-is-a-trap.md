title: Motivation is a Trap. Build a System Instead.
draft: false
---

We often wait for the feeling of motivation to tackle hard problems. That's a mistake. Motivation is unreliable - it comes and goes with your mood, your energy levels and the quality of your morning coffee. Relying on it is like building a critical service on a server that randomly shuts down.

The solution is to stop chasing a feeling and instead, trust a system.

Your calendar can be that system. Decide once what is important and schedule it. When the time comes, you don't consult your feelings - you consult the clock.

The real discipline is not about forcing yourself to do the work - it is about honoring the decision you made when you were thinking clearly. The work follows automatically.
