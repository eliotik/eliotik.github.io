title: Focus on results, a flawless process is meaningless without them
draft: false
---

Achieving results is what truly matters, and I learned it hard way.

Imagine a team that follows every step of a project plan perfectly but delivers a product that fails to meet business or customer needs.

Despite their flawless process, the outcome is mediocre.

In contrast, another team faced challenges, adapted on the fly, and delivered a product that makes customers happy and bumps company's metrics up.

Their process wasn't perfect, but the result was a success.

The takeaway?

> Good process is important, but it should not overshadow the ultimate goal - deliver results!
