Hey there, I'm Alexander, the guy behind `Novi Fyx` content. By day, I'm an Engineering Manager hustling through the intricacies of leading a team. 
By night, I'm a dad and a tinkerer, diving into DIY projects, coding experiments, and all things 3D.

Ever wondered what it's like to juggle engineering responsibilities with the chaos of parenthood? Me too. 

On this blog, I spill the beans on the real-life challenges and victories of balancing a career in engineering with the joys of raising kids.

Expect no-nonsense(maybe) insights into the world of code. I will be exploring the realm of 3D printing and modeling. No fancy jargon, just practical tips for turning ideas into digital designs into tangible wonders.

If I feel lucky, I will explore circuits, sensors, and the nitty-gritty of building robots. No rocket science, _maybe_...

This blog isn't just about technical know-how. I share my thoughts and musings on life, because, let's face it, we're all just trying to figure it out. It's a mix of DIY, coding, and dad life, minus the corporate-speak and with a dash of humor.

`Novi Fyx` isn't a space for **buzzwords**; it's a place where genuine **curiosity** meets practical insights. So, if you're into the raw, unfiltered side of engineering, parenting, and tinkering, you're in the right spot!
